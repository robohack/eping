# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Description of changes per release
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

970828
	Linux portability fixes.
		On certain platforms the standard include files expect
		the symbol __BSD_SOURCE whereas the compilers define
		the symbol  _BSD_SOURCE instead.
	Minor portability fixes.
		Use explicit casts for ntohs()/htons() in a few places
		to avoid compiler warnings on some platforms.
	There are no functional changes in this release.

970525
	More linux portability changes.
		Certain newer linux versions now define struct ip.
		It remains unclear what the exact criteria are.
		Move include of linux.h to a more appropriate place.

961230
	Port to linux platform.
		Some additions were needed to the linux.h include file.
		This file is now invoked by port.h if appropriate.
		Tested by Larry Schwimmer <rosebud@cyclone.Stanford.EDU>
	Portability issues.
		Bypass bug in <netinet/ip.h> on alpha osf/1 platform.
		From Larry Schwimmer <rosebud@cyclone.Stanford.EDU>
	Optionally restrict special ping modes.
		The special ping modes can be disallowed for ordinary
		users via individual compile-time switches in conf.h
		or all at once via a Makefile configuration definition.
		Asked by Larry Schwimmer <rosebud@cyclone.Stanford.EDU>
	Extra safety checks.
		After a positive return from an ordinary gethostbyname
		or gethostbyaddr we cannot be absolutely sure that the
		size of the canonical h_name is within bounds.
		Make timeval subtraction more robust.
	Configurable defaults.
		Make various default values configurable in conf.h
	Miscellaneous changes.
		Attempt to further reduce lint clutter. It is difficult
		to eliminate this altogether. There are too many subtle
		differences between various platforms.
	More preparation for multi-target mode.
		Add new code in preparation for multi-target mode a la
		fping. Still not complete.

960314
	Add loose source route gateways.
		New option -g to specify (possibly multiple) gateway
		machines to define an explicit loose source route to
		the target host. This works the same as in traceroute.
	Check for available routing info.
		If an IP options buffer is returned, make sure that it
		contains routing info. Some hosts fail to insert routes.
		Macintoshes sometimes fill the entire buffer with NOPs.
	Configurable default options.
		Use an environment variable PING_DEFAULTS to set
		default options and parameters. These are interpolated
		in front of the command line arguments before scanning.
		Syntax is the same as the command line syntax.
	Broadcast statistics.
		Add more statistics for hosts during broadcast mode
		(times are questionable because of extra overhead).
	Broadcast address mask.
		New option -b to specify the number of bits in the
		network mask. Overrules the traditional class masks
		when checking for a broadcast address.
	New options.
		Allow packet length and packet count to be specified
		alternatively via new -l and -k options. Traditionally
		they are given as extra parameters after the target.
		Change the undocumented -T option to -w.
	Allow MULTIPLE_IP_OPTIONS.
		The default is now to allow multiple IP options.
		We assume this is ok for most of today's routers.
		Only for very old Cisco routers it should be turned off.
	Miscellaneous changes.
		Split large subroutines into more modular ones.
		Reorganize several modules in preparation of multi-
		target mode (a la fping).

960303
	Cache nameserver lookups.
		DNS address-to-name translations are cached to avoid
		excessive DNS queries. Use same code as in traceroute.
		This allows to include full domain names in the output
		for regular responses.
	Adjust timeout for slow links.
		If the round-trip time turns out to be larger than the
		given timeout period, auto-adjust the timeout to avoid
		injecting too many packets into the pipeline.
		Suggested by Bela Lubkin <belal@sco.COM>
		This feature is experimental and subject to change.
		Change the text of the "no reply" messages to be less
		confusing.
	Set screen window size.
		Initialize and dynamically update the window size of
		the screen in cisco-ping mode.
	Portability fixes.
		Minor changes to run on SCO platforms.
		SCO/OS5 comes with its own version of in_cksum().
	Port to linux platform.
		Add compatibility definitions in separate linux.h
		header file. This file is not yet invoked, as it is
		untested so far.

951024
	Correct various misspellings.
	There are no functional changes in this release.

951016
	Enhance rtt statistics printout.
		Add the standard deviation to the statistics summary.
		Supply simple sqrt function to avoid linking with -lm.

951015
	Refine round-trip time reporting.
		Print rtt appropriately in fractional milliseconds.
		The number of printed digits depends on the value.
		(Example:  0.123 ms  1.23 ms  12.3 ms  123 ms).
		This can be useful for measuring very fast links,
		but should be taken with a grain of salt on systems
		with a poor clock resolution.
	Miscellaneous changes.
		Properly terminate stdout in special ping modes before
		issuing a message to stderr, to improve readability.
		Ensure rtt values don't cause overflow. This limits
		their values to ~35 minutes. That seems sufficient.

950930
	Avoid potential alignment conflicts.
		Allocate socket addresses of type struct sockaddr_in
		instead of type struct sockaddr. The first one has
		stricter alignment restrictions, although they have
		the same size.
	There are no functional changes in this release.

950918
	Disable all reverse DNS lookups in numeric mode.
		The -n flag now also prevents a reverse lookup of a
		numeric dotted quad address given on the command line.
		This avoids a potential annoying nameserver timeout.

950910
	Enhance error reporting.
		Keep track of ICMP messages that explicitly reject our
		ping requests, such as host unreachable and the like.
		They are generated by intermediate hosts in transit.
		Such errors are reported, and statistics accumulated,
		instead of ignoring them and finally timing out.
	More IP packet dump printout.
		In verbose mode, also print ICMP portion of IP packet,
		not only TCP or UDP data.
	Improve robustness.
		Ensure all input packets are of sufficient size before
		processing them. This was silently assumed when dumping
		their contents in verbose mode.

950805
	Recognize new ICMP codes.
		Some new ICMP packet types and ICMP_UNREACH subcodes are
		now detected. The latest codes are defined by RFC 1812.
		Suggested by Steinar Haug <Steinar.Haug@runit.sintef.no>
	Minor changes.
		Change capitalization and text in icmp header printout.

950425
	Multiple address support.
		New option -a to probe all addresses of a multi-homed
		host in succession. Requires some code reshuffling.
		This makes the separate rping utility obsolete.
	Ensure consistent exit code.
		Return success code if any valid response was received,
		and failure code if there were none.
	Save/restore errno across interrupts.
		This is necessary for those system calls which are
		interrupted instead of restarted. It avoids stale
		values in the regular mode code in case of certain
		race conditions.
	Add the RELEASE_NOTES file to explain changes.

940704
	General portability fixes.
		Use predefined constants for fixed size entities.
		Cannot rely on sizeof() for several structs on those
		platforms which don't have 16 or 32 bit integers.
		Adapt checksum algorithm to be more portable.
	Minor changes.
		Release root privileges when they are no longer needed.

940306
	Miscellaneous changes.
		Word-align all 32-bit addresses in IP options buffer.
		Check class D (multicast) and class E (reserved) address.
	Broadcast improvements.
		Keep track of different host responses in broadcast mode.

940226
	Loose source route support.
		New option -L to enable loose source route mode.
		Recognize option -l for compatibility with SUN ping.
	Generalize IP options processing.
		Restrict simultaneous use of more than one IP routing
		option, unless allowed via an explicit compile switch.
	Broadcast support.
		Implement special processing for broadcast pings.
		Restrict options if a broadcast address is specified.
	Quick ping.
		New option -Q for quick ping without statistics.
	Minor enhancements.
		Make messages during verbose packet reporting uniform.
		Properly pluralize words in output messages.
	Manual page revised and adapted to new features.

940217
	Complete overhaul of entire code. Various bugs fixed.
		General portability hooks for various platforms.
		Improved error reporting and timeout handling.
		Corrected output print format depending on options.
		Properly schedule next event in various modes.
		More robust code in several places.
	Redesign flow control to properly handle flood mode.
		This ensures that packet loss figures are now reliable.
	New option.
		Undocumented option -T to set timeout in flood mode.

940212
	Portability changes.
		Use setvbuf() if setlinebuf() is unavailable.
	Minor enhancements.
		Use float format to print percentage packet loss.
		Suppress output in quiet flood mode.
		Miscellaneous lint cleanup.
	Various bug fixes.
		Save hostname properly in sufficient static storage.
		Correct checksum algorithm for odd bytecount.

910926
	Minor bug fix.
		getopt() returns int instead of char.
	Hack for special ethernet interface.
		Put omninet (NC400) controller in promiscuous mode.
		This is necessary for record route mode to work.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# CHANGES
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugs fixed

	Checksum algorithm.
		The ICMP packet checksum was computed incorrectly
		in case the packet contained an odd number of bytes.
	Hostname storage.
		The hostname as returned via gethostby{name,addr} was
		pointing to internal storage which would be clobbered
		by subsequent calls. Furthermore, MAXHOSTNAMELEN is
		not sufficient to store fully qualified domain names.
	Response printout.
		The printing of the response messages was not always
		according to the specified options.
	Event scheduling.
		The scheduling of new events and termination was not
		always properly corresponding to the specified options.
	Packet loss report.
		Packet loss is now properly reported. Especially when
		running in flood mode the figures were bogus.

New features

	Internal redesign.
		Necessary to properly handle flood mode and broadcast.
	Portability hooks.
		New Makefile and header files to ease installation on
		various platforms.
	Loose source route.
		Can be specified instead of, or in combination with,
		record route. Handling of IP options is generalized.
		See conf.h for potential conflicts with record route.
	Broadcast support.
		Added hooks to handle broadcast address in all modes.
		Restrict the use of flood ping to the superuser when
		a broadcast address is specified.
	Quick ping.
		Suppresses all output and quits when target is alive.
	Ping all addresses.
		Probe all addresses of a multi-homed destination host.
	Recognize new ICMP codes.
		New types and subcodes have been defined recently.
	Improve robustness.
		Don't assume that all input packets are of sufficient
		size when decoding their contents.
	Enhance error handling.
		Recognize and act upon ICMP bounce messages and report
		error conditions.
	Refine round-trip time reporting.
		Print rtt appropriately in fractional milliseconds,
		in variable format (significant digits only).
		Add the standard deviation to the statistics summary.
	Update screen window size.
		Maintain proper number of columns in cisco-ping mode.
	Cache nameserver lookups.
		Avoid multiple DNS queries for known IP addresses.
	Adjust timeout for slow links.
		Adapt the timeout value if it is too small compared to
		the actual round-trip time.
	Customizing default options.
		Environment variables can be used to preset often used
		options.
	Loose source route gateways.
		Define explicit loose source route to the target host.

	Timeout messages.
		The "no reply" messages are just indicating that no
		reply was received *within the given timeout period*.
		They don't necessarily mean a lost packet.
		You will see them if the target host is reachable via
		a slow link and the given timeout value is less than
		the actual round trip time.
		As new packets are emitted and the pipe gets filled,
		the messages will go away eventually (if the line has
		a rather constant round-trip time).
		The timeout period is now adjusted to cope with slow
		and irregular lines.
