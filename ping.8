.SH DESCRIPTION
The Internet is a large and complex aggregation of network
hardware, connected together by gateways. Tracking a single-point
hardware or software failure can often be difficult.
.I ping
utilizes the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO request datagram to
elicit an ICMP ECHOREPLY from a host or gateway.
ECHO request datagrams (``pings'') have an IP and ICMP header,
followed by a \fBstruct timeval\fR, and then an arbitrary number
of ``pad'' bytes used to fill out the packet.
.sp
Default datagram length is 64 bytes (8 ICMP header bytes + 56 data bytes),
but this may be changed using the command line option \fIlength\fP.
.sp
The number of ping packets is unlimited, unless an explicit \fIcount\fP
is specified.
.PP
The default mode is to send a packet every \fItimeout\fP seconds and
display the response, including sequence number and round-trip time
if the packet size allows.
.sp
Two other modes are available (which are mutually exclusive):
.SH SPECIAL MODES
.TP
.B \-c
Use cisco style packet sending; that is, spew packets as fast as possible,
but don't send packet N+1 until a reply or bounce or timeout has been
registered for packet N.  A '!' is printed for every valid response received
and a '.' is printed when no packet is received during the \fItimeout\fP
period.  A duplicate response causes a '*' to be printed.
When a ping request is bounced in transit, a '#' will be printed.
.TP
.B \-f
Use floodping style packet sending; send packets as fast as possible,
attempting to send at at least 100 packets per second.  A '.' is printed
for every packet sent and a backspaced '!' for every valid response
(a backspaced '#' when a ping request is bounced in transit).
The number of visible dots indicates how much ping is ``behind''.
A '*' is printed whenever a duplicate packet is received.  While waiting
for outstanding packets during termination a '!' is printed per valid
response and a '#' per bounced request.
.SH FLAGS
.TP
.B \-F
Fast ping.
In normal mode, send a packet as soon as a response is received without
delaying for the regular timeout period. This is similar to cisco style
except for the printing of the response messages.
.TP
.B \-Q
Quick ping.
This suppresses all normal output as well as the final statistics
summary.  The program quits with an ``alive'' indication as soon
as a valid response is received. It quits with an ``unreachable''
indication as soon as a bounce message is received.
.TP
.B \-L
Insert "loose source route" IP option in outgoing packets.
Without explicit gateways given by the \fB\-g\fP option, this selects
a route to the destination host and back to the source host.
This option only works on systems that allow setting of IP options.
.TP
.B \-R
Insert "record route" IP option in outgoing packets, summarizing the
routes the packets have traveled when the program quits.
In "very verbose" mode, the route is displayed for each reply received.
This option only works on systems that allow setting of IP options.
.TP
.B \-a
All-address mode.
If the destination host has multiple addresses, ping will probe
all addresses if this option is set. Normally only the first address
as returned by the DNS resolver is attempted.
.TP
.B \-m
Missed mode.
Enable printing of a summary of missed valid responses at the end.
.TP
.B \-n
Numeric mode.
Disable reverse hostname lookup of all IP addresses.  By default both
hostname and IP address of the destination host are displayed in the
header, summary, and "record route" surveys, as well as in the response
messages (the latter is safe since all lookups are now cached to avoid
excessive nameserver queries).
If the reverse hostname lookup fails, just the IP address is displayed.
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet mode.
Disable printing of ping response messages and special mode markers,
only display the summary when quitting.
This option is implied in quick (-Q) mode.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.
All received ICMP packets, including other than our own ECHOREPLY
packets, are listed and a summary printout of their contents is made.
When specified as \fB\-vv\fP (very verbose), loose source route and record
route information (if present) is displayed for each response received.
.TP
.B \-d
Enable socket level debugging with the SO_DEBUG option.
.TP
.B \-r
Enable socket level processing with the SO_DONTROUTE option. Bypass the
normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached network.
If the host is not on a directly-attached network, an error is returned.
This option can be used to ping a local host through an interface
that has no route through it (e.g., after the interface was dropped by
.IR routed (8C)).
.TP
.B \-V
Just print the program version number, then exit.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-t " timeout"
In normal mode, this is the interval in seconds for sending ping messages.
In cisco or fast mode, this is the timeout ping will wait for a reply
before sending the next packet. In these modes a new ping is sent as soon
as a valid reply is received. In flood mode this timeout does not apply.
The default value is 1 second.
.TP
.BI \-s " source_addr"
Use the following IP address (which must be given as an IP number,
not a hostname) as the source address in outgoing probe packets.
On hosts with more than one IP address, this option can be used to
force the source address to be something other than the IP address
of the interface the probe packet is sent on.  If the IP address
is not one of this machine's interface addresses, an error is
returned and nothing is sent.
.TP
.BI \-g " gateway"
Construct a "loose source route" via this gateway to the target host.
Up to 8 of such intermediate hosts can be specified.
This option only works on systems that allow setting of IP options.
.TP
.BI \-l " length"
Alternative option to specify the size of the ping packets.
.TP
.BI \-k " count"
Alternative option to limit the number of ping packets to be sent.
.TP
.BI \-p " preload"
Specifies the number of packets to preload. They are sent at startup before
listening for a response. The default is to not send any preload packets.
.TP
.BI \-b " netbits"
Specify the number of bits in the netmask that applies to given addresses.
This overrules the traditional class masks when checking whether a given
address is a broadcast address.
.TP
.BI \-D " pattern"
Specifies the pattern to fill unused data in the packets. The default is
to fill with the data position modulo 256. A pattern is a string of hex
digit pairs used to specify the contents of the bytes of the packet.
The pattern is replicated until it fills the entire packet.
.TP
.BI \-T " tos"
Set the
.I type-of-service
in probe packets to the given value (default zero). The value must
be a decimal integer in the range 0 to 255.  This option can be used to
see if different types-of-service result in different delays.  (If you
are not running 4.4bsd, this may be academic since the normal network
services like telnet and ftp don't let you control the TOS). Not all
values of TOS are legal or meaningful \- see the IP spec for definitions.
Useful values are probably `-T 16' (low delay) and `-T 8' (high throughput).
.SH OPERATION
When using \fIping\fR for fault isolation, it should first be run on the
local host, to verify that the local network interface is up and running.
Then, hosts and gateways further and further away should be ``pinged''.
\fIping\fR sends one ECHO datagram per \fItimeout\fP period, and prints
one line of output for every ECHOREPLY returned (or a warning if a bounce
message is received or no response at all).
.sp
If an optional \fIlength\fP is specified, it is used as the length of the
data portion of the ICMP ECHO request packet.  The default \fIlength\fP
is 56 data bytes.
If an optional \fIcount\fP is given, only that number of requests is sent.
.sp
Round-trip times and packet loss statistics are computed. When all responses
have been received or the program times out (with a \fIcount\fP specified),
or if the program is terminated with a SIGINT, a brief summary is displayed.
Additional info is printed depending on the command line flags.
.PP
This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement
and management. It should be used primarily for manual fault isolation.
Because of the load it could impose on the network, it is unwise to use
\fIping\fP during normal operations or from automated scripts.
.SH EXIT STATUS
\fIping\fP returns a success (zero) exit code in case any valid response
was received, and a failure (nonzero) code if there were none.
.SH WARNING
Specifying both \fB\-L\fP and \fB\-R\fP simultaneously may not work in all
circumstances, in the sense that it may confuse certain old Cisco routers.
They will clobber their ARP cache, replacing the ethernet address of the
client host with the ethernet address of the next hop along the route.
This will make subsequent normal IP traffic to and from the client host
impossible until the ARP cache is cleared again. This may take some time.
Setting both options is restricted to the superuser, unless the program
is compiled with a special compile switch indicating it is safe.
.SH "BROADCAST ADDRESS"
Specifying the broadcast address of your local network as the target for
ping yields a nice survey of all active hosts. The internal logic has
been adapted to handle such broadcasts properly. All ping modes are
supported, but a flood ping is restricted to the superuser only.
Fast pings and cisco pings are now timeout-driven.
Broadcasts to different networks usually don't cross gateways.
Checking for a broadcast address is only rudimentary. The \fB\-b\fP
option may be necessary in case subnetting is employed.
