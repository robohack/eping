# (e)Ping

An enhanced version of the venerable `ping` utility for testing IPv4
networks and hosts.

This version has a "Cisco" mode, as well as a similar "Fast" mode, and
of course the regular "flood" mode.  There's also a "quick" mode, for
alive/unreachable tests; and an "all-address" mode, for hosts with
multiple addresses (as given in the DNS).  Finally this version also has
support for performing network surveys when using the broadcast address.


### Rest In Peace Eric Wassenaar.

Eric Wassenaar was killed in a traffic accident on April 10th of 2000.
He was the original author of `vrfy`, as well as of several other
programs that were commonly known as the NIKHEF-NL network tools, after
the National Institute for Nuclear Physics and High Energy Physics in
Amsterdam where he worked and was responsible for their network
operations and their connection to the Internet.  His original web page
at www.nikhef.nl/user/e07, and the FTP archive of his tools at
ftp.nikhef.nl, was removed shortly after his death.

See the tribute to him in the [NIKHEF 2000 Annual
report](https://www.nikhef.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Annual_Report-2000.pdf
"NIKHEF 2000 Annual report").

I have maintained Eric's versions of `host`, `ping`, and `vrfy` since
then.
